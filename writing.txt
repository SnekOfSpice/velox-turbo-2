3 way choice
There once was a boy (loopback)
Ever since he was able to think, his brain overflowed with suicide. Visions of his brains splattered on the floor. Wondering if the 5th story of his apartment complex was high enough. First attempt at age 11. Got raped at age 12. Put a knife in someone's stomach at age 13. Socially shunned. Correctional facility. Alone and violated - this is how he grew up.
Now, he's back out- probation. No one wants to touch him.
Not like a loved one would, at least.
Yet, he's still alive. For now.
He spends his time in dark alleyways, getting fucked by heterosexual men. None of them consider him one. Barely 17 but we both know he's older than that.
First attempt 6 years ago. Perpetual downward spiral. Won't be the only one.
Gets off on snuff porn now.
You know how the rest of the story goes.


There once was a girl
It is a somewhat cold winter morning - abated by the radiator on full blast. She awakes, cuddled up with a friend she was banging. Ate them out, got eaten out. Bit them, got bruised. Lots of kisses. A good time. [reword if rules don't allow it: cradling and affirming and pleasuring one another.]
We find her at some time in her 20s.
Cold winter sunlight flitters across the scars on both of their forearms - years old.




There once was a faggot
(cut? It came to stumble out of a correctional facility.) Got into bad shit too early. Family didn't know how to handle its coming out and other shit happened that does not concern you or me or it.
Dead past.
No future.
Very presently - Cut up forearms.

The faggot's hands are stained. Imagine whatever fluid is most repulsive to you. It has that on its tongue.
It finds comfort in the other faggots, some of them faggots that are girls, some of them girls that are faggots.
Estrogen isn't the first injection this one does.
